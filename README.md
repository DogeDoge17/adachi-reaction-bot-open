it uses playwright

when building with playwright for the first time, you will have to install its browsers.

1. build the program
2. get the error saying the playwright browsers aren't installed
3. open the command prompt
4. navigate to the base project folder on the command prompt. the command will look something like: cd C:\Users\\{username}\source\repos\adachi-reaction-bot-open
5. run this command: pwsh bin/Debug/net7.0-windows/playwright.ps1 install

it should install and work then
